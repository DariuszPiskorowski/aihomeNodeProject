# aihomeNodeProject
This repository was created to test the functionality of GitHub Actions CI/CD. It contains the code of a node operating in a real environment for managing a smart home. This node was originally created on a Raspberry Pi 4 and then recreated on a locally running Docker Desktop. Visual Studio Code was then connected to Docker for the purpose of debugging the code in Live mode on the running Docker. Therefore, this repository actually contains the node code with a prepared port 9229 for "controlling" and debugging the running node process in Docker.
